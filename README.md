# Highlight Google Ads

> What is thing?

This is a dead simple Firefox extension to make ads in Google search results really stand out:

> But...why would I want to highlight ads?

Google has changed the way paid ads are displayed in search results over the last few years, slowly but surely until they are _nigh-indistinguishable_ from organic results. I might click on an advertisement, sure, but I want to know that's what I'm doing when I do it.

Exactly! Of course, installing an extension to make search results more prominent isn't [the best solution](https://duckduckgo.com) -- but every little bit helps.  Even if you've already made the switch to a better search engine you'll still inevitably end up on a Google results page sometimes and it's good to be informed when you do.
